        History
    </em>
</h3>

    <p>
        The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into the
        New World. The high bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish, French, and the
        English as Memphis took shape. Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans: John Overton, James Winchester, and future president
        Andrew Jackson.[7]

        Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods, natural resources like lumber, and the
        American slave trade. After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it
        became among the largest world markets for cotton[8] and lumber.

        Home to Tennessee's largest African-American population, Memphis played a prominent role in the American civil rights movement and was the site of
        Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1968 assassination. The city now hosts the National Civil Rights Museumâ€”a Smithsonian affiliate institution.
        Since the civil rights era, Memphis has grown to become one of the nation's leading commercial centers in transportation and logistics.
        The city's largest employer is the multinational courier corporation FedEx, which maintains its global air hub at Memphis International Airport,
        making it the second-busiest cargo airport in the world.
