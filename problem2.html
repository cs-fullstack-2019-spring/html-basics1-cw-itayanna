            About me
        </h3>
        I am 21 years old, and I live in midtown here in the beautiful city of Memphis. I am an aspiring developer as well as an R&B artist.
        I am receiving my education at CodeCrew and I am absolutely loving the course. I have only been a programer for 3 weeks, but I know so much already.
        I know ultimately I want to use my coding knowledge for game development as well as using my music background to do scoring for those games.
        If you would like to hear some of my music you can go to my YouTube chanel which I have linked on the side.
